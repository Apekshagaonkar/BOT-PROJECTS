# fruit_plucking_bot
CREDITS : S
The main idea behind this was to improve the harvesting and reduce production cost.
This is just a prototype for the harvesting robot.This will reduce the dependency on labors.
We have built this robot using raspberry pi as the processing part that carries out image processing part and the arduino for robotic arm since it is very fast for sensors and actuators.
